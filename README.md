A collection of open-source tools and utilities to extend and enhance [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui), a modern front-end interface for self-hosted large language models (LLMs). Open WebUI is similar to ChatGPT but designed for local or self-hosted LLMs, supporting connections to models via the OpenAI API interface.

This project provides reusable, modular, and easy-to-integrate components for developers working with custom LLM setups through Open WebUI.

## What is Open WebUI?

Open WebUI is a sleek, extensible front-end for interacting with LLMs (such as Llama, Mistral, etc.) that are self-hosted or run on your own infrastructure. It offers a familiar chat interface like ChatGPT, but is focused on privacy, flexibility, and the ability to connect to any LLM supporting the OpenAI API standard.
