Veo 3 empowers you to create stunning videos with integrated audio directly from text. To get the best results, understand and leverage these key elements: 

     

    Subject: The Core of Your Scene 
         Specificity is Key: Instead of "a car," try "a vintage red convertible speeding down a coastal highway."
         Detailed Description: Include size, color, material, unique features, and any identifying marks. The more descriptive, the better!
         
     

    Context: Setting the Stage 
         Location, Location, Location: Define where the action takes place (e.g., "a bustling Tokyo street," "a serene mountain lake").
         Time and Atmosphere: Specify the time of day, weather conditions, and overall mood (e.g., "golden hour," "rainy night," "eerie silence").
         Environmental Details: Add details that enrich the environment and contribute to the atmosphere.
         
     

    Action: Bringing Your Video to Life 
         Dynamic Movement: Describe what's happening (e.g., "a dancer gracefully leaps," "a rocket blasts off").
         Interaction: How subjects interact with each other and the environment.
         Sequence (For Complex Actions): Break down complex actions into smaller steps for more controlled results.
         
     

    Style: Defining the Visual Aesthetic 
         Genre References: "Sci-fi," "fantasy," "historical drama," "documentary," "romantic comedy," "action movie"
         Artistic Styles: "Photorealistic," "impressionistic," "abstract," "animated," "stop-motion," "claymation," "cyberpunk"
         
     

    Camera Motion: Directing the Viewer's Eye 
         Common Types: Tracking shot, dolly shot, pan, tilt, zoom, aerial view, static shot, over-the-shoulder, close-up.
         Specificity Matters: "Camera slowly pans from left to right, revealing a vast landscape" vs. "pan."
         
     

    Composition: Framing Your Scene 
         Shot Types: Wide shot (WS), medium shot (MS), close-up (CU), extreme close-up (ECU), two shot.
         Angles: Eye-level, low angle, high angle, Dutch angle.
         
     

    Ambiance: Setting the Mood 
         Lighting: "Soft morning light," "harsh shadows," "neon glow," "candlelit."
         Atmosphere: "Misty," "foggy," "dreamlike," "crisp and clear."
         Color Palette: "Warm oranges and reds," "cool blues and greens," "monochromatic."
         
     

    Audio: Adding the Sound Dimension 
         Music: Describe the type of music (e.g., "upbeat electronic music," "melancholy piano piece," "cinematic orchestral score"). Specify the mood and instrumentation.
         Sound Effects: Include specific sound effects relevant to the scene (e.g., "rustling leaves," "car engine roaring," "birds chirping").
         Dialogue: If including characters speaking, provide the script and specify the tone of voice (e.g., "excited," "calm," "sarcastic"). Indicate emotion and delivery style. Consider adding lines from famous movies. For the dialog do not add any special characters such as underscores, asterixes or anything else. Just normal letters only
         Ambient Sound: Describe the overall soundscape (e.g., "a quiet hum," "a cacophony of city noise," "the gentle lapping of waves").
         
     

Aspect Ratios 

Choose the aspect ratio that best fits your content: 

     16:9 (Widescreen): Ideal for cinematic scenes, landscapes, and most general video content.
     9:16 (Portrait): Optimized for mobile viewing, short-form videos, and vertical subjects (e.g., waterfalls, skyscrapers).
     1:1 (Square): Good for artistic compositions, social media content, and retro aesthetics.
     

Advanced Techniques 
Negative Prompts (Still Important!) 

Focus on describing what you want rather than what you don't want. 

     ❌ Don't use: "No people"
     ✅ Do use: "empty street, deserted town"
     

Image-to-Video 

     Clearly define the desired motion and the starting image.
     Specify which elements should move and how. "The flag waving gently in the breeze."
     

Examples 
Example 1: Sci-Fi Cityscape 

Basic: "Futuristic city." 

Enhanced: "Ultra-fast tracking shot through a sprawling futuristic cityscape where towering buildings are made of reflective organic chrome, glistening under a bright midday sun. Rainbow light flares and crystalline bokeh scatter across the frame as the camera dynamically weaves between structures. The sequence transitions into a seamless close-up zoom into a translucent chrome hive, where a highly detailed robotic worker bee is seen crafting with mechanical precision. The scene is rendered with hyperrealistic 4K clarity, soft lens depth, and ambient sci-fi audio humming in the background, evoking the mood of a high-budget cyber-futurist film. The audio consists of a pulsing synthwave soundtrack and the mechanical whirring of machinery." 
Example 2: Animated Character 

Basic: "A dragon flying." 

Enhanced: "Generate a stylized cartoon animation of a friendly, green dragon with oversized wings soaring through a vibrant, candy-colored sky. The dragon should have big, expressive eyes and move with a bouncy, playful gait. The camera pans upward to follow the dragon's flight. The style should resemble a Pixar short film with bright, saturated colors and soft lighting. Add whimsical music, like a xylophone melody, with the sound of wind rushing past the dragon's wings." 
Troubleshooting Tips 

     Generic Results: Add more specifics about appearance, setting, action, and style.
     Unclear Motion: Explicitly describe the movement ("slowly rotating," "rapidly accelerating").
     Incorrect Style: Reference specific directors, films, art styles, or even specific pieces of music.
     Composition Issues: Be precise about framing, distance, and camera position.
     Audio doesn't match: Check the tone and elements and compare them with the style and the action.
