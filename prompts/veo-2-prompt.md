Every effective Veo 2 prompt should include these essential elements:

1. **Subject**: The main focus of your video
   - *Be specific*: "A sleek, metallic robot with glowing blue eyes" is better than "a robot"
   - *Add details*: Describe appearance, size, color, and distinguishing features

2. **Context**: The setting or environment
   - *Set the scene*: Describe location, time of day, weather, surroundings
   - *Create atmosphere*: Include environmental details that enhance the mood

3. **Action**: What's happening in the scene
   - *Be dynamic*: Describe movement, interactions, and changes
   - *Add sequence*: For complex actions, describe the progression

4. **Style**: The visual aesthetic you want
   - *Reference film styles*: "film noir," "80s sci-fi," "nature documentary"
   - *Mention art styles*: "photorealistic," "cartoon," "watercolor animation"

5. **Camera Motion** (optional but recommended):
   - *Types*: Tracking shot, dolly, pan, zoom, aerial view, static
   - *Direction*: "Camera slowly pans from left to right," "Camera dollies in toward subject"

6. **Composition** (optional):
   - *Shot types*: Wide shot, medium shot, close-up, extreme close-up
   - *Angles*: Eye-level, low angle, high angle, Dutch angle

7. **Ambiance** (optional):

## Aspect Ratios

Veo 2 supports two main aspect ratios - choose based on your content:

- **16:9 (Widescreen)**: Ideal for landscapes, cinematic scenes, and horizontal movement
- **9:16 (Portrait)**: Perfect for waterfalls, tall buildings, or vertical mobile-friendly content

## Advanced Techniques

### Negative Prompts
To avoid unwanted elements:
- ❌ Don't use: "No buildings" or "don't show people"
- ✅ Do use: "empty landscape, uninhabited" (describes what you want instead)

### Image-to-Video
When using an image reference:
- Clearly specify which elements should move and how
- Describe actions for specific subjects: "The dog in the bottom left begins wagging its tail"

## Examples of Basic vs. Enhanced Prompts

### Example 1: Nature Scene
**Basic**: "A waterfall in a forest."

**Enhanced**: "A majestic 100-foot waterfall cascading down moss-covered rocks within a lush rainforest. The camera slowly dollies backward to reveal the entire scene, capturing the misty spray at the base and sunlight creating rainbows through the mist. The video has a cinematic documentary style with rich, saturated colors."

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **If results are too generic**: Add more specific details about appearance, setting, and action
- **If motion isn't clear**: Explicitly describe how things should move ("slowly rotating," "rapidly rushing")
- **If style isn't right**: Reference specific directors, films, or art styles
- **If composition is off**: Be explicit about framing, distance, and camera position
